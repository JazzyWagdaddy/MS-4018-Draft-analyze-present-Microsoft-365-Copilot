# Lab 6 - Outlook #

## Exercise ##
Imagine you're a project manager at Contoso, a mid-sized company. You're gearing up for the highly anticipated launch of your new product, Contoso Connect. This innovative product promises to revolutionize the way businesses connect and collaborate. To ensure a smooth launch, you need to coordinate a team meeting to discuss the final preparations. Then, you can use Copilot in Microsoft Teams to record the meeting and track action items.

### Exercise 1 - Draft an email with Copilot in Outlook ###
1. Open Microsoft Outlook and select New Email.
1. Enter key points in the body of the email. For instance:
  *let's enter Brainstorm ideas for the Contoso Connect product launch*
   
1. Select the on-canvas Copilot icon.
1. Ask Copilot to enhance your email by selecting the Auto rewrite option. It's still short, so use the Suggested prompts and ask Copilot to Make it longer.
1. Select Replace to include the suggested text as your email.
1. Review the email and make any necessary adjustments.
1. Add the recipients (your team members) and send the email.
