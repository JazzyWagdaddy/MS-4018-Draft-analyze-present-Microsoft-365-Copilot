# Lab 6 - Outlook #

## Exercise ##
Imagine you're a project manager at Contoso, a mid-sized company. You're gearing up for the highly anticipated launch of your new product, Contoso Connect. This innovative product promises to revolutionize the way businesses connect and collaborate. To ensure a smooth launch, you need to coordinate a team meeting to discuss the final preparations. Then, you can use Copilot in Microsoft Teams to record the meeting and track action items.
