## Exercise 1 - Create a new presentation based on a Word document

> [UIDifferences]
>  Please note that due to the fluid changes with the User Interface, some commands may need to be entered differently

1. Open the desktop version of PowerPoint and click on the second choice, **Blank Presentation**. For the purposes of this exercise, please **do not** choose the option to "Create with Copilot".
2. Once a blank presentation renders, click on the **Copilot** icon and select:

3. From within the Copilot chat window enter the following prompt, noting you may have to remove a backslash:
    *Create a presentation about Contoso's Chai Tea based on*
   
4. Next, In the prompt dialog box, enter a forward slash (/) followed by the name of the file **(Promotion Plan for Chai Tea in Latin America.docx)** and press the right-arrow. If the file doesn't populate in the MRU or Most Recently Used list, select the Upload button then **Attach Cloud Files**. Navigate to **My files** and select the document from your OneDrive folder.  Once all steps are completed, click the right arrow.

5. After a few moments, Copilot displays a presentation outline showing the potential slides and bulleted points to be included on each slide. Review the suggested content and click on **Generate Slides** in the lower right hand corner.  After a few moments, Copilot generates slides and content. Click **Keep it** to retain the presentation.
   
6. While this is a great start, you want to personalize the presentation a bit more for your delivery. Let's see how to improve the content.

## Exercise 2 - Ask Copilot to help you create an icebreaker slide
Copilot can help generate an idea and then a slide for a fun icebreaker to keep our audience occupied while others join.

1. Let's change the view in PowerPoint. Select **View -> Normal** and then return to the **Home** ribbon view.

1. If not already, open the Copilot pane and enter the following prompt:

     *Can you help me brainstorm an icebreaker question that would be good for a global audience? Provide three options for me to choose from*

     Copilot responds with suggestions for your icebreaker. If none of these questions fit what you're looking for, prompt Copilot to generate more suggestions: *Please suggest two different options* 

     The first question looks great for our audience, so let's ask Copilot to generate a slide with this question, a corresponding image, and to insert this as the first slide in the presentation.

1. Enter the following prompt:

    *Use question 1 as the icebreaker, and generate a slide that includes a complementary image*

   Please note that depending on various factors, it will take several minutes for Copilot to generate the slide. 

    Now, you've got a great way to start a conversation among your meeting participants. Let's look at the presentation now, and see how we can make it even more powerful.

1. Since Copilot can't directly insert the slide into your current presentation, enter this prompt *Yes, please provide the slide file*, noting it will take several moments for Copilot to complete this action.
   
3. Once Copilot finishes rendering, download the icebreaker slide.

## Exercise 3 - Insert an image

While Copilot includes images as it creates slides, you may want to add or edit an image to be more specific to your presentation. You can ask Copilot to include an image from your approved corporate library, provided your administrator has set the appropriate configurations, or generate an image based on an idea you have.

1. Let's ask Copilot to insert a diagram on the title slide. Navigate to the title slide that Copilot generate and enter the following prompt in the Copilot pane:

    *Replace the image on the Title slide with an image of a person sipping a warm cup of tea*

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to experiment with your own prompt to generate an image  you think would work best for the presentation. The more details you provide, the better.  Also note that it will take a moment or two for Copilot to render a new image.

## Exercise 4 - Edit the text

As you're reviewing the presentation, you may decide the text Copilot generated isn't right for you. Use Copilot to help you refine the text on your slides. For instance, you can type *Edit the text on this slide to make it more concise* or *Make this text more engaging for the reader* Let's see how:

1. Navigate to the slide containing the text you may want to edit. Select the slide, and in the Copilot pane, enter the following prompt:

    *Edit this text to make it more conversational*

1. Copy and paste the text you want to edit in the Copilot prompt dialog, then select **Send**.

1. Review the suggestions provided by Copilot, then choose **Yes, please update the slide with this text**

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the security settings within your environment and any data sensitivity labels your organization has established, Copilot may repond with the following message:
> *It looks like I wasn’t able to update the slide directly because I don’t have access to modify your open PowerPoint file.*
> Click on the option to provide the updated text in a separate file.

## Exercise 5 - Organize the presentation

As you're reviewing the presentation, you may find that the topics in your presentation need to be more clearly identified. You can use Copilot in PowerPoint to inject this clarity.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter the following prompt: 

    *Organize this presentation*

1. Copilot responds, providing suggestions for each slide. You can select to update the content as you'd like or iterate your prompt to receive additional suggestions. 

1. Ensure that your presentation has a logical sequence and smooth transitions between slides.

## (Optional) Exercise - Send a draft for review

Once you're satisfied with your presentation, use Copilot in Outlook to draft an email to your manager for review.

1. Launch Microsoft Outlook from your browser [outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com) or desktop application and select **New mail**.

1. Select the **Copilot** icon in the email composition window.

1. Enter the following prompt:

    +++Draft an email asking for a review of the presentation that I attached to this email. Write the email in a casual tone.+++

1. Select **Draft with Copilot**.

1. Review the email draft, make any necessary edits, and send it to your intended recipient.

And just like that, you're all set to impress your manager with a polished presentation! Happy presenting.
