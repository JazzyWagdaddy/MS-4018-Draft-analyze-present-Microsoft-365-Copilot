# Get M365 Copilot Ready!

## Exercise 1 - Course Prerequisites
Let's take a moment to ensure that you have everything that you need to be M365 Copilot Ready!

1. Please confirm that you have a M365 Copilot licenses assigned to your account.
2. Check for any Office updates and apply them.
3. Check for any Windows updates and apply them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please inform the instructor if you need to patch or update your computer so that we can plan accordingly and we minimimze any downtime due to potential reboots.

## Exercise 2 - Uploading Files to OneDrive
Throughout these labs, we'll be crafting prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot that reference the following files:

- [Promotion Plan for Chai Tea in Latin America.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269126)
- [Market Analysis Report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268826)
- [Contoso Chai Tea market trends 2023.xlsx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268822)

To ensure that these files are accessible later on by Microsoft 365 Copilot, we'll first upload them to OneDrive.

1. Log into your computer and open the **OneDrive** application by entering **OneDrive** in the Windows search bar.

2. Create a new folder named **MS-4018 Resource Files**.

3. Download all three files above and place them into the **MS-4018 Resource Files** folder.

### Referencing files

When referencing files from Copilot, you might find that you can't find some files from the suggestions provided to you. This happens sometimes because certain experiences with Copilot only reference files from the Most Recently Used (MRU) list, while others let you browse OneDrive to find your file. Adding them to that list is as easy as opening them up in the appropriate Microsoft 365 app.  Once they've been opened, they should appear in the MRU list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 Copilot will only work with files saved to OneDrive. If files are stored locally on your PC, you'll need to move them to OneDrive to activate Copilot.

As you progress, you'll have an opportunity to try out other prompts against these files and are encouraged to do so to explore and enhance your prompting skills.

## Exercise 3 - M365 Copilot UI Changes

As of June 2025, Microsoft is mid-process deploying what is called the "New Copilot Experience" globally.  This deployment is coming in waves and is controlled by Microsoft, and regretably a customer cannot enter the Admin portal and request a specific upgrade.

Additionally, there will be UI differences between the version of Copilot used:
* Standard Copilot
* Copilot Pro
* Copilot for Microsoft 365

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Three different user interfaces may be visible to learners in this course depending on the updated UI deployment and the version of Copilot used, and the instructor will educate the class on the three different versions that are currently available.  This course is designed for **Copilot for Microsoft 365.**

## Wave 1
In the first wave of deployment, the Copilot icon on the Office ribbon is converted from launching Microsoft 365 Copilot to launching Copilot Chat.  Clicking this icon **will not launch Microsoft 365 Copilot**, it will launch Copilot Chat, which is web-grounded only.

## Wave 2 - M365 Copilot in Applications
When Wave 2 is deployed to your account, you will now have different methods to launch Microsoft 365 Copilot based on the M365 application.  Please note this is not a consistent experience, meanining how you launch Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word differs from how you launch Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel, Outlook, etc.

### Here is the new UI for Microsoft 365 Copilot in Powerpoint:

### Here is the new UI for Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel:

### Here is the new UI for Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word:

## Wave 3 - App Skills
Once Wave 3 hits your account, the Copilot icon on the Office ribbon now has an additional choice, **App Skills**.  This means there are now two ways to launch M365 Copilot from the application, ableit the new App Skills options from the Office ribbon, or from within the office application itself as outlined in the Wave 2 update.
