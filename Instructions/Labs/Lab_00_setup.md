# Follow along using sample data with Microsoft 365 Copilot

Throughout these labs, we'll be crafting prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot that reference the following files:

- [Promotion Plan for Chai Tea in Latin America.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269126)
- [Market Analysis Report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268826)
- [Contoso Chai Tea market trends 2023.xlsx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268822)

To ensure that these files are accessible later on by Microsoft 365 Copilot, we'll first upload them to OneDrive.

## Uploading Files to OneDrive

Follow the steps below to upload all files needed to **OneDrive**:

1. Log into your computer and open the **OneDrive** application by entering **OneDrive** in the Windows search bar.

2. Create a new folder named **MS-4018 Resource Files**.

3. Download all three files above and place them into the **MS-4018 Resource Files** folder.

### Referencing files

When referencing files from Copilot, you might find that you can't find some files from the suggestions provided to you. This happens sometimes because certain experiences with Copilot only reference files from the Most Recently Used (MRU) list, while others let you browse OneDrive to find your file. Adding them to that list is as easy as opening them up in the appropriate Microsoft 365 app.  Once they've been opened, they should appear in the MRU list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 Copilot will only work with files saved to OneDrive. If files are stored locally on your PC, you'll need to move them to OneDrive to activate Copilot.

As you progress, you'll have an opportunity to try out other prompts against these files and are encouraged to do so to explore and enhance your prompting skills.

# M365 Copilot UI Changes

As of June 2025, Microsoft is mid-process deploying what is called the "New Copilot Experience" globally.  This deployment is coming in waves and is controlled by Microsoft.   A customer cannot enter the Admin portal and request an upgrade.

This means there are potentially three different user interfaces that may be visible to learners in this course, and the instructor will educate the class on the three different versions that are currently available.  

## Wave 1
In the first wave of deployment, the Copilot icon on the Office ribbon is converted from launching M365 Copilot to launching Copilt Chat.  Clicking this icon **will not launch M365 Copilot**, it will launch Copilot Chat, which is web-grounded only.

## Wave 2 - M365 Copilot in Applications
When wave 2 is deployed to your account, you will now have different methods to launch M365 Copilot in each M365 application.  Please note this is not a consistent expience, meanining how you launch M365 Copilot in Word differs from how you launch M365 Copilot in Excel, etc.

Here is the new UI for M365 Copilot in Powerpoint:

## Wave 3 - App Skills
Once wave 3 hits your account, the Copilot icon on the Office ribbon now has an additional choice, **App Skills**
