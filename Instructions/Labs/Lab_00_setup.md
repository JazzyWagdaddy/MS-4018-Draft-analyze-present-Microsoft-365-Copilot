# Follow along using sample data with Microsoft 365 Copilot

Throughout these labs, we'll be crafting prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot that reference the following files:

- [Promotion Plan for Chai Tea in Latin America.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269126)
- [Market Analysis Report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268826)
- [Contoso Chai Tea market trends 2023.xlsx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268822)

To ensure that these files are accessible later on by Microsoft 365 Copilot, we'll first upload them to OneDrive.

## Uploading Files to OneDrive

Follow the steps below to upload all files needed to **OneDrive**:

1. Log into the virtual machine provided by your tenant provider as the local **Administrator** account with the password `Pa55w.rd`.

2. Open the **OneDrive** application by entering **OneDrive** in the Windows search bar.

3. At the **Email address** prompt, enter userx@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com (provided by your tenant provider) and select **Sign in**.

4. At the **Enter password** screen, enter Password1 (provided by your tenant provider), then select **Sign in**.

5. If prompted to **Automatically sign in to all desktop apps and websites on this device?**, select **Yes, all apps**.

6. Open your OneDrive folder.
   
7. In a new instance of **File Explorer**, select **This PC** > **Local Disk (C:)** and open the **ResourceFiles** folder.

8. Select all files within the **ResourceFiles** folder, then drag and drop them into your OneDrive folder.

9. When the upload is complete, you should see **Uploaded 29 items to My files** in the bottom center of the screen.


### Referencing files

When referencing files from Copilot, you might find that you can't find some files from the suggestions provided to you. This happens sometimes because certain experiences with Copilot only reference files from the Most Recently Used (MRU) list, while others let you browse OneDrive to find your file. Adding them to that list is as easy as opening them up in the appropriate Microsoft 365 app.  Once they've been opened, they should appear in the MRU list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 Copilot  will only work with files saved to OneDrive. If files are stored locally on your PC, you'll need to move them to OneDrive to activate Copilot.

As you progress, you'll have an opportunity to try out other prompts against these files and are encouraged to do so to explore and enhance your prompting skills.
