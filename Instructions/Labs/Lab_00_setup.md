# Follow along using sample data with Microsoft 365 Copilot

Throughout these labs, we'll be crafting prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot that reference the following files:

- [Promotion Plan for Chai Tea in Latin America.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269126)
- [Market Analysis Report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268826)
- [Contoso Chai Tea market trends 2023.xlsx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268822)

To ensure that these files are accessible later on by Microsoft 365 Copilot, we'll first upload them to OneDrive.

## Uploading Files to OneDrive

Follow the steps below to upload all files needed to **OneDrive**:

1. Log into your computer and open the **OneDrive** application by entering **OneDrive** in the Windows search bar.

2. Create a new folder named **MS-4018 Resource Files**.

3. Download all three files above and place them into the **MS-4018 Resource Files** folder.

### Referencing files

When referencing files from Copilot, you might find that you can't find some files from the suggestions provided to you. This happens sometimes because certain experiences with Copilot only reference files from the Most Recently Used (MRU) list, while others let you browse OneDrive to find your file. Adding them to that list is as easy as opening them up in the appropriate Microsoft 365 app.  Once they've been opened, they should appear in the MRU list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft 365 Copilot will only work with files saved to OneDrive. If files are stored locally on your PC, you'll need to move them to OneDrive to activate Copilot.

As you progress, you'll have an opportunity to try out other prompts against these files and are encouraged to do so to explore and enhance your prompting skills.
