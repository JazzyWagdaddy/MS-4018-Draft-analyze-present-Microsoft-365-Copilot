# Lab 5 - Supercharge your collaboration with Copilot in Outlook

Imagine you're a project manager at Contoso, a mid-sized company. You're gearing up for the highly anticipated launch of your new product, Contoso Connect. This innovative product promises to revolutionize the way businesses connect and collaborate. To ensure a smooth launch, you need to coordinate a team meeting to discuss the final preparations. Then, you can use Copilot in Microsoft Teams to record the meeting and track action items.

#### Exercise 1 - Draft an email with Copilot in Outlook

1. Open Microsoft Outlook and select **New Email**.

1. Enter key points in the body of the email. For instance, let's enter *Brainstorm ideas for the Contoso Connect product launch.*

1. Select the on-canvas **Copilot** icon.

1. Ask Copilot to enhance your email by selecting the Auto rewrite option. It's still short, so use the **Suggested prompts** and ask Copilot to **Make it longer**.

1. Select **Replace** to include the suggested text as your email.

1. Review the email and make any necessary adjustments.

1. Add the recipients (your team members) and send the email.

#### Exercise 2 - Schedule a meeting with Copilot in Outlook

After you send the email, you want to schedule a meeting to discuss the points you included in person.

1. Open the email thread you sent.

1. Select the **Copilot** icon from the **Home** ribbon to open the Copilot pane.

1. Ask Copilot to suggest the best time for the meeting by entering *Schedule a meeting next week based on attendees' availability.* Copilot searches the calendars of your email recipients, and suggests a time based on their availability.

1. Review the suggested time.

1. Select **Edit** to add context to the meeting invite.  Let's include an agenda for our attendees.

1. Provide the key details in the email body. Invoke Copilot by including a backslash before the text: */Let's discuss the upcoming product launch, review the project timeline, and assign tasks.*

1. Select **Draft with Copilot**. Copilot displays suggested prompts, or you can manually answer **What is the purpose of this meeting?**.

1. Prompt Copilot to *Add an agenda and rewrite this email in a professional tone.*

1. Select **Generate**.

1. Review Copilot's suggestion and select to **Replace** the original text.

1. **Send** the invite to your attendees.
