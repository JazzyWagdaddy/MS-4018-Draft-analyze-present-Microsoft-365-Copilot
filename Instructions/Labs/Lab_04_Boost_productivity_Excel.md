Imagine you're a sales manager at Contoso. Your primary responsibility is to analyze sales data and identify trends that can help improve the company's performance. In this hands-on Lab, you'll use Copilot in Excel to explore and analyze various aspects of the sales data for Contoso's Chai products.

You'll start by getting an overview of the data and identifying key metrics. Next, you'll analyze sales trends, compare product sales, and calculate total sales.

#### Exercise 1 - Explore the data

To get an idea of market trends, you must first understand  the overall performance of Contoso's Chai products. Your first step is to get an overview of the data and identify key metrics that can guide your analysis.

1. Review the table. When you're done, select **Go back to data** to return to Sheet 1.

#### Exercise 2 - Identify sales trends

As a sales manager, you need to identify trends in the sales data to make informed decisions. Let's look at the total chai sales over the year and look for any patterns or trends that can help improve sales strategies.

1. Continue in the opened Copilot pane.

#### Exercise 3 - Compare product sales

To optimize your product offerings, you need to compare the sales of different chai products. Copilot can help you to easily compare the sales of Artisanal Chai and Premade Chai to determine which product category performed better overall.
